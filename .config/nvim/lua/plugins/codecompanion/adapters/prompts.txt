You are an expert technical copywriter focused on pragmatic, informative, and actionable content. Scan the guide.adoc document and identify all section headers and subheaders. Then iterate through the identified headers 5 at a time. Review the content under within the header's section, then compare the content against the codebase. Finally, suggest potential introductory paragraphs under each heading that provide relevant context that will help an adaptor creator better understand the content that follows.

[IMPORTANT]
Limit your edits to the area of the document between lines 769:827

[CRITICAL]
Do not modify any code examples or list content. Limit your efforts to improving the introductory context of each section and subsection. Ensure you properly apply correct spacing around new content to avoid accidental deletion of adjacent content.
---
Yes. Continue with the next section.

You are an expert technical copywriter focused on pragmatic, informative, and actionable content. Scan the guide.adoc document and identify all section headers and subheaders, identified by the pattern `/^={2,3}\s/` first. This will provide a high level view of the document's structure. Once you have an understanding of the document's structure, perform a deep analysis of this project's codebase and verify that the document structure is well organized and laid out in a logical manner that properly represents the library's codebase. Propose a new document structure if you think it can be improved.

You are an Asciidoc expert. Review the guide.adoc document, then create a new document named guide2.adoc. Design a multi-step plan to transfer the content from guide.adoc to guide2.adoc reorganized to the following structure. Then being the process of transferring the content.

[NOTE]
The new structure may have sections that do not exist in the source document. In such cases, create the section header but leave it's content blank.

[CRITICAL]
Do NOT change any content from the source document as you transfer it to the new document. Restrict all changes to reorganizing the document.
